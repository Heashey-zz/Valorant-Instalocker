# Valorant-Instalocker

This instant locker is 100% safe, and cannot get you banned.

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to Coordinates.h
2. Here you will see the X & Y of characters, this is where your mouse will move on the screen.
3. Change the X & Y depending on where your characters are located, I recommend downloading just color picker and looking at the x & y.
4. If your character is on the top line the Y will always be: 925.
5. If your character is on the bottom line the Y will always be: 1010.
6. After you changed the coordinates, you can compile and run it.
7. Hold Space to Instalock.
